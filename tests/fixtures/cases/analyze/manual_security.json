Create a PDF with embedded JavaScript\n2. Process it with process_with_scripts() function\n3. The JavaScript is evaluated using Python's eval()\n\n## Impact\nThis could allow arbitrary code execution through malicious PDF files. The eval() call in pdf_processor.py is dangerous.\n\n## Suggested Fix\nRemove or sandbox JavaScript evaluation during PDF processing.",
