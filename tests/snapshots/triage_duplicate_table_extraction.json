However, the report lacks critical information needed to investigate and verify the fix: no sample PDF document is provided or linked. To reproduce and resolve table extraction issues, the development team needs an actual PDF file that demonstrates the problem. The user should provide either a sample PDF attachment, a link to a problematic document, or clear reproduction steps with a specific document they can share.",
